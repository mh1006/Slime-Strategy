  dialogue:
  - "You\u2019re our new commander, I take it?\nYou should know just who fights for
    you."
  - "Let\u2019s start with me and my sibling.\nWe\u2019re Warriors. We run fast and
    hit hard. \nBut we don\u2019t like taking hits. "
  - "That\u2019s where our Knight comes in. \nA real glutton for punishment, that
    one. "
  - "Finally, there\u2019s our Archer. \nWhat they lack in power and durability,
    \nthey make up for with great range."
