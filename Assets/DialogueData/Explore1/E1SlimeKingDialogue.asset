  dialogue:
  - "My child, \nI have called you here for an urgent mission. "
  - "It turns out that just as I lead you, \nthere is a man leading those humans."
  - "They honour him with a title: \u2018king\u2019. \nTheir devotion is enshrined
    in this shiny, \ngolden headpiece he wears \u2013 a \u2018crown\u2019. "
  - "But clearly, there is someone worthier of \nthat title and that headgear: yours
    truly."
  - "From now on, I shall be known as the slime king. \nAnd although my nobility
    is plain to see, \nI require the perfect hat to seal the deal."
  - "Go get me that \u2018crown\u2019! \nI am a far truer king than he shall ever
    be."
